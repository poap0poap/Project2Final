# Board working
To Do List:
1. Board Distribution between both the harder and easier path.
2. Advisors with Implementation and Initializing on Game Start Up.
3. Events with Implmementation and Interaction with Advisors. 
4. Riddles with the implementation of Purple Tile
5. Ending Part when landing on the last tile. Need to make it so it skips the turn for the other play who isn't at the finish line yet.

# Changes
created struct to hold player data
need to make classes


25% chance of random event on all tiles
50% chance of 0 or 2 to random stat on black tile

main path starts normal 
side path 50% easier until middle

main path gets +10pt
side path get -5pt and advisor

every 10 turns damage from events goes up by 1

events hurt points based on current stats
  ex - main path windstorm does -5pt but for every 10 stamina does 1pt less damage
     - side path until middle windstorm does -3pt but for every 10 stamina does 1pt less damage
     - reach 0 points you get -1pt to all stats each turn
advisor can negate certain events
