# Board working
made the board work and allow you to move on both paths. 

Still need to do for the board
  - path chosing
  - menuing - complete
  - skip turn after reach end

# Changes
created struct to hold player data
need to make classes


25% chance of random event on all tiles
50% chance of 0 or 2 to random stat on black tile

main path starts normal 
side path 50% easier until middle

main path gets +10pt
side path get -5pt and advisor

every 10 turns damage from events goes up by 1

events hurt points based on current stats
  ex - main path windstorm does -5pt but for every 10 stamina does 1pt less damage
     - side path until middle windstorm does -3pt but for every 10 stamina does 1pt less damage
     - reach 0 points you get -1pt to all stats each turn
advisor can negate certain events
